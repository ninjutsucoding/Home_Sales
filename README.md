# Home_Sales
Module 22

No outside resources were used to complete this Module.
I referenced the past activities and used the Xpert Learning Assistant to complete this Module. 

I was not suprised the cached home_sales query was slower than the other 2 because the dataset was so small.
If the dataset was bigger, I would expect to see a much improved performance by the cached query.

In the grading comments it said i used date_built instead of the date on Question 1.   I believe i used the year of the date and not the date_built.  

I fixed the floor number from 3 to 2 for question 5.

I also fixed the code to get the average price at a view rating instead of the average price / view rating for questions 6, 8, 11.
