Module 22

No outside resources were used to complete this Module.
I referenced the past activities and used the Xpert Learning Assistant to complete this Module. 

The cached data and the parquet data were both faster than the normal sql function as expected.
There wasn't much difference between the cached data and the parquet data because I don't think the data size was big enough.  

Resubmit
In the grading comments it said i used date_built instead of the date on Question 1.   I believe i used the year of the date and not the date_built.  

I fixed the floor number from 3 to 2 for question 5.

I also fixed the code to get the average price at a view rating instead of the average price / view rating for questions 6, 8, 11.
