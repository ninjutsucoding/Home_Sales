# Home_Sales
Module 22

No outside resources were used to complete this Module.
I referenced the past activities and used the Xpert Learning Assistant to complete this Module. 

I was not suprised the cached home_sales query was slower than the other 2 because the dataset was so small.
If the dataset was bigger, I would expect to see a much improved performance by the cached query.
